# Rabbit-Hole-Traverser

## Overview
Tired of those "never-ending" quote tweets that just takes up your time rummaging through click-bait tweets? Want to just check and see the origin of those tweets and maybe see how many tweets does it take you to reach it? This Python script does that job for you! Only works on tweets of public accounts.

## Setup
* Make sure to have the latest [Python3 version](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all required python libraries

## Usage
To start the script, run `python rabbit_hole_traverser <is_verbose?> <starting_tweet_url>`.  Add the starting tweet url in place of `<starting_tweet_url>`. (Optional, default=true) Add `true` or `false` in place of `<is_verbose>`.
